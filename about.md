I am Kamil Lygas and I’ve worked in IT for over 14 years. I’ve been a subject matter expert in various technologies throughout my career including Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, and Citrix Cloud. 

With over 14 years of experience in analysis, design, implementation, testing, rollout, support, and maintenance of infrastructure across a breadth of industries. I’m a natural problem solver with excellent analytic skills, quickly able to understand customer requirements and break these down into actionable solutions.

I am currently a Cloud Solutions Architect working for [HTG - Secure Cloud Experts](https://htg.co.uk "HTG - Secure Cloud Experts") with offices in Edinburgh, London, Newcastle and Belfast.
