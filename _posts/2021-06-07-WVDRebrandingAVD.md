Microsoft has announced today that Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) will be rebranded as Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD).  

Going forward, organizations will need to support an evolving set of remote and hybrid work scenarios. To help our customers and partners meet these new hybrid work demands, we are expanding our vision to become a flexible cloud VDI platform for nearly any use case—accessible from virtually anywhere. A modern VDI platform needs to be secure, scalable, and easy to manage, while delivering a seamless, high-performance experience to end users. It should also empower organizations with the flexibility to customize and build solutions with its core technology.

To support this broader vision and the changing needs of our customers, today we are announcing new capabilities, new pricing for app streaming, and changing the name of the Windows Virtual Desktop service to Azure Virtual Desktop.

Some of the key features that are coming soon in public preview:

#### Enhanced support for Azure Active Directory ####

+ Azure Active Directory is a critical service used by organizations around the world to manage user access to important apps and data and maintain strong security controls. We are pleased to announce that you’ll soon be able to join your Azure Virtual Desktop virtual machines directly to Azure Active Directory (AAD) and connect to the virtual machines from any device with basic credentials

#### Manage Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session virtual machines with Microsoft Endpoint Manager ####

+ Microsoft Endpoint Manager allows you to manage policies and distribute applications across devices.

Microsoft also announced new pricing options for remote app streaming in AVD, here is a link to the full article [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-virtual-desktop-the-desktop-and-app-virtualization-platform-for-the-hybrid-workplace/)
